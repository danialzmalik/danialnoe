        <p>
            I found this new panagram and I love it.
            This is definitely the way to do it because I think it'll be more fun.<br>
            Lets just keep this short and simple. I will be updating this daily hopefully.
            This will be a public tracker of whether I am accomplishing my goals.
            <br>
            <br>
            My first <b>vow</b> is to journal daily and post to the site.
            This accountability will keep me going.<br>
            Today was Day05 and I cracked. But instead of reseting like usual, I will continue and work hard.
            Only 1hr and 20min. That time should have been spent on site dev.<br><br>
            Today was spontaneous which is the excuse/rationalization. Its not addict behavior if I'm not preplanning
            it.
            I was basically planning it since the morning and it was "whoops how did that happen" by the time I was back
            from the gym.
            <br>
            <br>
            I feel refreshed now, but that is a problem. I cant keep doing this. I need to spend time moving forward.
            I need to create things that make me proud that I can share with friends. I've been stagnant long enough.
