        <h1>Cardio into Lunch</h1>
        <p class="journal-entry">
            I woke up around 9am today and spent an hour herklin.
            After finally getting my lazy butt out of bed, I decided to spent an 40 minutes deciding if I really wanted
            to do cardio this early.
            <br>
            (Un?)Fortunately the answer was yes.
            <br>
            <br>
            I did cardio for an hour and then got ready lickity split to get to Butcher 360.
            I'm trying to avoid tolls to save money, but I was running late so I had to pay up.
            By the time I reached the parking lot, they had just gotten inside so good thing I was on time.
            <br>
            We had a great meal with laughs and catching up, but I feel like it was mostly superficial.
            I dont know how to break into the deeper talks.
            Maybe its a timing or location issue, not the right vibe at a kbbq lunch.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now its 3pm and I'm sitting in the NB Library writing this out.
            Its still early so I should get more work done.
            I think it would be nice to get some progress on my long term todos.
            <br>

            Oh yea I think Samran said he would be coming over later today so maybe we hang out at night?

        <h2>Philosophy of Self Improvement (and reflection)</h2>
        <p class="journal-entry">
            What is our understanding of reality shaped by. Our life experiences shape us into who we are. The people we
            talk to influence the decisions we make. Yet there are so many people who say that we cannot change who we
            are fundamentally. I dont think that is true. I think we are constnatly evolving and deciding what we want
            to do. There are definitely habits that have been ingrained since childhood that are difficult to get rid of
            or to even be aware are there. Those require great understanding of self and
            <br>
            <br>
            Filling up my space with stuff and more and more stuff has just been a distraction I think.
            <br>
            Having a clean workspace does wonders. Typing this out in a library where all I have in front of me is my
            laptop, glasses, phone, and bag. Surrounded by tomes of knowledge and scriptures of tales, the slight murmur
            of librarians, distant children excitedly enjoying innocence. Man what an old man I've become. Am I really
            going to end my life with such sadness.
