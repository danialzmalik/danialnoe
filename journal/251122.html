        <h1>Cardio into Lunch</h1>
        <p class="journal-entry">
            I woke up around 9am today and spent an hour herklin.
            After finally getting my lazy butt out of bed, I decided to spent an 40 minutes deciding if I really wanted
            to do cardio this early.
            <br>
            (Un?)Fortunately the answer was yes.
            <br>
            <br>
            I did cardio for an hour and then got ready lickity split to get to Butcher 360.
            I'm trying to avoid tolls to save money, but I was running late so I had to pay up.
            By the time I reached the parking lot, they had just gotten inside so good thing I was on time.
            <br>
            We had a great meal with laughs and catching up, but I feel like it was mostly superficial.
            I dont know how to break into the deeper talks.
            Maybe its a timing or location issue, not the right vibe at a kbbq lunch.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now its 3pm and I'm sitting in the NB Library writing this out.
            Its still early so I should get more work done.
            I think it would be nice to get some progress on my long term todos.
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh yea I think Samran said he would be coming over later today so maybe we hang out at night?
